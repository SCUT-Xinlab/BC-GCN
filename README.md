# BC-GCN
Implementable trained model and code for the paper "Brain Connectivity based Graph Convolutional Networks for Infant Age Prediction" submitted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging.

There are three models: BC-GCN, BC-GCN-Res and BC-GCN-SE in model.py, of which BC-GCN-SE is the final model used in paper. And train_demo.py is a demo to describe input and output formats and demonstrate the basic training process.

## Code environment

python 3.8

pytorch 1.4.0
